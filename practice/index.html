      This falls lies on Dindigul-Kodai route just 7kms away from Kodaikanal
      town.This falls is formed from excess water of Kodai lake and you can have
      a nice view of the falls.Now they closed the falls noone can take bath
      under the falls.There will be very big crowd as it lies on the main road
      and need to for a few minutes to take nice photographs.

      The perfect stop-over in between a long journey from Madurai to
      Kodaikanal, the silver cascade falls demand your attention while you
      travel. These Falls are formed as a result of the over flowing of water
      from man-made Kodai Lake & are the perfect spot to have a break during a
      long road trip. As tunning sight of water thrashing down from 180 feet
      right into the ground below and mesmerizing one and all with its sheer
      strength and beauty . One can also take a bath in the water showers of the
      falls provided the temperature is right As falls site is slightly off from
      main road, one can easily relax , take photographs etc. & also enjoy some
      cool drinks available at site during tourist season. One can also enjoy
      the exquisite mouth watering local fruits which are available with fruit
      sellers. Unmatched experience & donâ€™t feel like leaving the place.
